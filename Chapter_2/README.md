Chapter 2: Analysis of field work on the Mt. White population

Here is the script I applied to my data set to create ANOVAS and graphs of eac of the four health metrics:

Plant volume:
Log 10 transformed volume measurements of healthy plant canopy. ANOVA and Box and Whisker plot with error bars used to display this data.

Plants flowering:
Binomal GLM on plants flowering (yes or no). ANOVA and Stacked Box plot were used to display this data.

Canopy cover:
Healthy canopy cover estimate. ANOVA and Box and Whisker plot with error bars were used to display this data. 

Canopy health:
A score given based on the canopy health, (amount of canopy and qaulity of canopy) ANOVA and Box and Whisker plot with error bars were used to display this data.
