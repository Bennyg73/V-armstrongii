#MLG (Number of multilocus genotypes (MLG) observed) is a measure of genotypic richness. eMLG is a value that corrects for uneven sampling sizes
#Diversity measures incorporate both genotypic richness and abundance. There are three measures of genotypic diversity employed by poppr, the Shannon-Wiener index (H), Stoddart and Taylor’s index (G), and Simpson’s index (lambda). Hexp = Nei's 1978 gene diversity (expected heterozygosity)
