Chapter 3: Genomic anlayses of Veronia armstrongii.

1. Full filtering of vcf file:
Here is the code used on the command line to filter a vcf file as outlined in my thesis. This code was applied to each data but the parameters for each filtering technique were changed.

2. R script for PCA, DAPC, UPGMA, Pairwise Fst and AMOVA:
Here is the R script used in R studio to visualize the changes that the filtering parameters made on the data set. This script was ran on each data set to see if the structure of the data changed based of the filtering parameters. 

3. Frequency based analyses:
Here is the scriot I used to calculate observed and expected heterozgozity values and genotypic richness. This script was ran on all data sets but only the ecology data set is presented within the tesis. 

4. GBS2PLOIDY script:
Here is the script I used to measure the cytotpe difference between samples. This script was ran on each data set to see if there was a difference between the 3 main data sets.
